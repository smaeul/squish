ABOUT
=====
Squish is a suite of data compression and analysis tools.

BUILDING
========
Run `make`. Compiled binaries will be placed in build/bin. This will also run
the test suite. If for some reason this is not desired, you can run `make bin`
or `make lib` to make just the binaries or library respectively.

FILE FORMAT
===========
squish v0
---------
The file shall begin with a header as follows:
   6 bytes: the UTF-8/ASCII string "squish"
   1 byte : the version number 0
   1 byte : flags (all reserved)
   8 bytes: uncompressed data length in bytes as an unsigned integer in network
            byte order
   8 bytes: reserved
1024 bytes: Huffman table of 256 4-byte entries containing the codeword for each
            possible byte value. Each code is preceded by a 1 bit and stored as
            an unsigned integer in network byte order.
The remaining bytes to the end of the file are compressed data. Any unused bits
in the final byte shall be set to zero.
